title: "Reaction Wheel Pendulum"
---

## Project Overview
**Dates:** January 2023 â€“ May 2023  
**Affiliation:** University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign

Designed a control system for a **Reaction Wheel Pendulum** to achieve stabilization at the inverted equilibrium (180 degrees). This project showcased **advanced control theory** and demonstrated real-world challenges in dynamic systems, including friction and sensor offsets.

- **Key Objectives**
    - Stabilize the pendulum at its inverted position using a reaction wheel, demonstrating dynamic control and state feedback.
    - Explore the effects of nonlinearities and friction on the control strategy.

- **Approach**
    - **Three-State Feedback Controller**: Implemented a controller that accounted for pendulum angle, reaction wheel speed, and overall stability.
    - **Friction Compensation**: Derived theoretical and experimental data to improve control performance under continuous testing.
    - **MATLAB & Simulink**: Modeled and simulated the system before implementing on hardware, ensuring accurate real-time validation.

- **Results**
    - Achieved robust stabilization even under small disturbances, demonstrating **10% higher pivot angle** stability and **50% higher disturbance tolerance** compared to simpler designs.
    - Delivered a functional prototype, underscoring proficiency in modeling, control algorithms, and real-time implementation.
