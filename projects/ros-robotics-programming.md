## Project Overview
**Dates:** January 2023 â€“ May 2023  
**Affiliation:** University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign

Integrated advanced robotics concepts using **ROS**, kinematics, and vision-based algorithms to construct a **composite bridge structure** through a robotic pick-and-place task. This task involved:
- Detecting multi-colored blocks (three blocks total).
- Precisely stacking them into two leaning towers.
- Ultimately forming a stable, visually impressive bridge.

### Key Highlights
- **Marker Detection Algorithms**: Used centroid and orientation detection to guide the robotic manipulation of blocks.
- **Inverse Kinematics**: Ensured precise block positioning, enabling a stable and visually striking bridge.
- **Robust Stack Angle Detection**: Implemented a method for fine orientation adjustments, critical for architectural arrangements.
- **Real-World Challenges**: Overcame camera calibration issues, block positioning inaccuracies, and environmental noise via strategic workspace planning.
- **Result**: Achieved a 232 mm bridging, demonstrating a significant application of robotics in complex assembly tasks despite hardware and calibration constraints.

### Skills
- C++
- Computer Science
- Teamwork
- Robot Operating System (ROS)
- Time Management
