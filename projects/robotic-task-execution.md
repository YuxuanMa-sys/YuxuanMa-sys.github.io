---

## Project Overview
**Dates:** January 2024 â€“ May 2024  
**Affiliation:** University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign

We designed and implemented the **Autonomous Multi-Step Robotic Task Execution System** for a CRS robot arm, enabling precise navigation, obstacle avoidance, and task-specific operations.

- **Key Challenges & Goals**
    - Tackling real-world robotic challenges by developing a system capable of performing complex multi-step tasks
    - High repeatability, rapid weight adaptation, and precise path following in a **competitive time frame**

- **Notable Features**
    - **Trajectory Optimization**: Maintained stability during force-sensitive tasks (e.g., controlled egg pressing)
    - **Depth-Sensitive Maneuvers**: Used a **zig-zag path** for accurate obstacle avoidance
    - **PID Control & Grasping**: Implemented **task-space PD control** with friction compensation, utilizing the Jacobian transpose for accurate force application
    - **MATLAB & Embedded Programming**: Leveraged advanced algorithms in MATLAB for real-time monitoring and data visualization

- **Results**
    - Successfully demonstrated robust multi-step control logic in both **simulation** and **physical** environments
    - Showcased hands-on **robotic control** skills, real-time sensing, and **task-sequencing**
