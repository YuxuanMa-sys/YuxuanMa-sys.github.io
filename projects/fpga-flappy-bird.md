title: "Dynamic 'Flappy Bird' on FPGA"
---

## Project Overview
**Dates:** August 2023 – December 2023  
**Affiliation:** University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign

We created a **hardware-based version of "Flappy Bird"** to explore how classic games can leverage real-time performance on an FPGA rather than relying on software emulation. Key aspects include:

- **Enhanced Frame Rendering & Memory Constraints**  
  Required careful module design to handle graphics smoothly without buffering delays.

- **Custom VGA Controller & Pillar Dynamics**  
  Managed color mapping and object movement to maintain smooth on-screen animation.

- **Real-Time Challenges**  
  Split the system into parallel hardware modules (e.g., bird movement, collision detection, scoreboard tracking), ensuring consistent frame rates and responsive controls.

- **Debugging & Extras**  
  Implemented a scalable background scheme and an “invincible mode” to aid debugging, along with a scoring function and start/end screens for a polished in-game experience.

- **Outcome**  
  Delivered a fully functional game showcasing comprehensive FPGA programming, digital design, and user-interface responsiveness—highlighting the potential of **hardware-based solutions** for interactive applications.
