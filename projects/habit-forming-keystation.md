## Project Overview
**Dates:** January 2024 – May 2024  
**Affiliation:** University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign

The **Habit-Forming KeyStation** was designed to help users build the habit of consistently placing and finding their keys. By integrating **RF tracking** and **pressure sensors**, this solution issues reminders to users when keys are left in the wrong place or missing altogether.

- **Key Features**
    - **RF Tracking & Sensor Fusion**: Combined an ultra-wideband DWM1000 module for reliable proximity detection with force-sensing resistors (FSRs) to accurately detect item placement.
    - **Automated Reminders**: Provided audio or visual alerts when keys weren’t returned within a set time, encouraging consistent organization.
    - **Calibration & Noise Handling**: Addressed challenges in continuous power usage and false positives by refining sensor thresholds and implementing noise filtering.

- **Results**
    - Developed a functional prototype capable of detecting missing keys within a 1-meter radius.
    - Demonstrated **circuit design**, **PCB design**, and **embedded systems** skills, culminating in a user-friendly device.
    - Showcased an **iterative design process** that combined hardware and software for practical, everyday use.
