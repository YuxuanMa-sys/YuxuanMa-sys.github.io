title: "Reproducibility Research for Research Software (Docker, Python, YAML)"
---

## Project Overview
**Dates:** August 2024 â€“ December 2024  
**Affiliation:** University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign

This project tackled the challenge of **replicating research artifacts** from top-tier computer science publications. Many published papers suffer from software decay, incomplete documentation, or unavailable dependencies, leading to reproducibility issues.

- **Key Contributions**
    - Introduced **Dockerfiles** and **metadata files (YAML)** for 26 published papers.
    - Developed container-based solutions to simplify environment setup and ensure consistent runs across different systems.
    - Conducted **thorough testing** in ephemeral environments to identify build failures, stability issues, and version incompatibilities.
    - Investigated **software archaeology** methods to trace outdated dependencies and propose viable updates.
    - Demonstrated reproducibility efforts by **proposing practical solutions** to software decay in research artifacts.

- **Results & Impact**
    - Successfully validated and **rebuilt** artifacts by implementing functional tests.
    - Ensured synergy with original research claims by demonstrating **dynamic analysis** in controlled environments.
    - Provided guidelines and container templates to help other researchers adopt reproducible practices.
